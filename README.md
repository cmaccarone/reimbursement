# reimbursement

A Reimbursement Application for Android and IOS that will handle reimbursements for the Washington Conference of Seventhday Adventists

## Getting Started

Main Features

- Users submit Trip Approval Requests
     - admin approves these
     - user then submits receipts
          - imported receipts are checked with past receipts for duplicates
     - Treasury then reimburses receipts
     - These receipts are exported in aggregate into two different csv files and two different pdf files (with pictures of the   receipts for backup), the csv's can then be imported into APS, or AASI and the PDF's used for back up. (this speeds up the reimbursement process.

### Potential Future Features

- Integration with APS/AASI Servers 
     - for looking up User ID's
     - importing reimbursements
     - Reading Departmental Budget values
      
- Messaging (for users to ask questions about their reimbursements/for us to communicate potential problems or clarify issues)
    - Trip Specific?
